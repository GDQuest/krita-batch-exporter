A Free and Open Source Krita plugin for designers, game artists, and digital artists to work more productively.

Batch Exporter brings smart batch layer export and renaming. With it, you can **automatically re-export** groups and layers to specific folders, **scale images on export**, and more! All that using Krita 4's new background save. If you've ever used Photoshop's Generator feature, this is similar.

Our goal is to extend and enhance powerful but underused features that already exist in Krita to empower artists.
