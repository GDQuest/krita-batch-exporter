Batch Exporter brings smart batch layer export and renaming. With it, you can **automatically re-export** groups and layers to specific folders, **scale images on export**, and more! All that using Krita 4's new background save. If you've ever used Photoshop's Generator feature, this is similar.

Our goal is to extend and enhance powerful but underused features that already exist in Krita to empower artists.

## How to Use and video demo

You can find a [video intro and tutorial](https://youtu.be/jJE5iqE8Q7c) on our YouTube channel.

The plugin also comes with [text-based](https://github.com/GDquest/krita-batch-exporter/blob/master/batch_exporter/Manual.md) documentation.

## How to install

Here's how to install the add-on. We are currently working for it to be included in Krita by default. Until then, here's how to install it.

### Using the auto-install script

You can run the install script `./install-krita4.2.sh` from your terminal. On Windows, you must run this program from a bash shell. If you have git installed, you can use git bash, otherwise the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

```sh
chmod +x install-krita4.2.sh # Make the program executable
./install-krita4.2.sh # Executes the program and installs the add-on
```

It should install all the files you need for the add-on to work in Krita 4.2.x. It can also upgrade the add-on for you, replacing older versions you had already installed.

### Manual installation

To install the add-on manually, you need to:

1. Download the "Source code (zip)" file in the [latest release](https://github.com/GDQuest/krita-batch-exporter/releases)
1. Open Krita and go to the Settings menu -> Manage Resources
1. Click "Open Resources Folder" to access your Krita resources directory
1. Copy and paste the `krita_batch_exporter/` folder and the `kritapykrita_batch_exporter.desktop` file in the `pykrita/` directory.

### Activating the add-on

To activate the add-on:

1. Restart Krita.
2. Go to the Settings menu -> Configure Krita -> Python Plugin Manager.
3. Click the checkbox next to GDQuest Batch Exporter.

You are now ready to use it!
